## Cadsoft Eagle Libraries - mostly for audio applications

**bao.lbr** is the main library

**baoPanel.lbr** is mostly intended for creating panel cutout layouts to be exported to .dxf for cnc punching/lasercut. Probably not a good idea, but worked for me so far.

**baoUtil** contains utilities for component placement like rulers, grids...

### the "Legacy" folder contains previous versions of parts, for backward compatibility

---

_Up to bao09.lbr the libraries were made with Eagle 7.6.0
From that one on everything is made in Eagle 9.0.1_

I created most of the footprints, some of them are edited versions of footprints from other sources.

### TODO: 
 * Transfer all footprints intended for home-etching-only to a separate library, like baoHomeEtch.lbr.
   I stopped home-etching about an year ago, but someone could find them useful.
   
* split library into categories? like baoCONN for connectors, baoUI for user interface components, etc..

* I'm adding schematic symbols to packages, hopefully all packages are going to be complete devices one day.
